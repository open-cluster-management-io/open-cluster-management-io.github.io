&lt;h2 id="supported-version">Supported version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The OCM v1.0.0 requires addon-framework v0.9.3 and above versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And notice there&amp;rsquo;s breaking changes in &lt;a href="https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/developer-guides/addon/#automatic-installation">automatic installation&lt;/a> in addon-framework version v0.10.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Add-on is an extension which can work with multiple clusters based on the foundation components in open-cluster-management.
Add-ons are Open Cluster Management-based extensions that can be used to work with multiple clusters.
Add-ons can support different configurations for different managed clusters, and can also be used to read data from the hub cluster.
For example, you might use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/managed-serviceaccount">managed-serviceaccount&lt;/a> add-on to collect the tokens from managed cluster back to the hub cluster,
use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/cluster-proxy">cluster-proxy &lt;/a> addon to establish a reverse proxy tunnels from the managed cluster to the hub cluster, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VScode Extension</title><link>https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/developer-guides/vscode-extension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/developer-guides/vscode-extension/</guid><description>&lt;p>The OCM &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm-vscode-extension">VScode Extension&lt;/a> is a UI tool for OCM related Kubernetes resources.
The extension has been built upon Visual Studio Code and offers additional OCM administrative and monitoring features in order to improve operational efficiency and accelerate development within engineering teams.
The OCM VScode Extension provides tons of useful features, including easy to generate OCM related Kubernetes resources, automated local OCM environment creation and a simple and convenient monitoring view for cluster resources.
Having an effective UI tool for managing your cluster is key to a healthy environment. With the right user interface, you can administer changes to the cluster, track resources, and troubleshoot issues more efficiently, without having to use numerous additional CLI tools.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
