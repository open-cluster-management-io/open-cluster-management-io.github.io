      <description>This page tells you the architecture and basic concepts in open-cluster-management.
   Hub cluster Klusterlet Managed cluster Application lifecycle Governance and risk     Hub cluster    The hub cluster is the common term that is used to define the central controller that runs in a Kubernetes cluster. The hub cluster aggregates information from multiple clusters by using an asynchronous work request model.
Klusterlet    The klusterlet is an agent running on the cluster managed by the hub.</description>

      <description>May 24, 2021 April 22, 2021     May 24, 2021    Michael Elder put together a user walk through for the basic Open Cluster Management API using kind, olm, and other open source technologies. See https://github.com/mdelder/open-cluster-management-getting-started for more details.
April 22, 2021    Inspired by the famous article Kubernetes The Hard Way, Dario Minonne created a tutorial for setting up Open Cluster Management the hard way.</description>

      <description>The are two ways to install the core control plane of open cluster management that includes cluster registration and manifests distribution.
   Prerequisite Install from source Install community operator from OperatorHub.io     Prerequisite    Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.
Prepare one Kubernetes cluster to function as the hub. For example, use kind to create a hub cluster.</description>

      <description>After the cluster manager and klusterlet are installed, you can install the policy framework components to the hub and the managed clusters.
   Prerequisite Install from prebuilt images on Quay.io     Prerequisite    You must meet the following prerequisites to install the policy framework:
  Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
  Ensure Golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.</description>

      <description>After the cluster manager is installed on the hub cluster, you need to install the klusterlet agent on another cluster so that it can be registered and managed by the hub cluster.
   Prerequisite Install from source Install community operator from OperatorHub.io What is next     Prerequisite    Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.</description>
