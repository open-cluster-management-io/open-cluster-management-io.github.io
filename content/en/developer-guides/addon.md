## Overview

Add-on is an extension which can work with multiple clusters based on the foundation components in open-cluster-management.
Add-ons are Open Cluster Management-based extensions that can be used to work with multiple clusters.
Add-ons can support different configurations for different managed clusters, and can also be used to read data from the hub cluster. 
For example, you might use the [managed-serviceaccount](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/managed-serviceaccount) add-on to collect the tokens from managed cluster back to the hub cluster,
use the [cluster-proxy ](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/cluster-proxy) addon to establish a reverse proxy tunnels from the managed cluster to the hub cluster, etc.

A typical add-on should consist of two kinds of components:

**Add-on agent:** The components running in the managed clusters which can be any kubernetes resources, for example   
it might be a container with permissions to access the hub cluster, an Operator, or an instance of Operator, etc.

**Add-on manager:** A kubernetes controller in the hub cluster that generates and applies the add-on agent manifests to the managed clusters 
via the ManifestWork API. The manager also can optionally manage the lifecycle of add-on.

There are 2 API resources for add-on in the OCM hub cluster:

**ClusterManagementAddOn:** This is a cluster-scoped resource which allows the user to discover which add-on is available 
for the cluster manager and also provides metadata information about the add-on such as display name and description information. 
The name of the `ClusterManagementAddOn` resource will be used for the namespace-scoped `ManagedClusterAddOn` resource.

**ManagedClusterAddOn:** This is a namespace-scoped resource which is used to trigger the add-on agent to be installed 
on the managed cluster, and should be created in the `ManagedCluster` namespace of the hub cluster. 
`ManagedClusterAddOn` also holds the current state of an add-on.

There is a library named [addon-framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework) which provides 
some simple user interfaces for developers to build their add-on managers easily.

We have some available add-ons in the OCM community:

* [cluster-proxy](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/cluster-proxy)
* [managed-serviceaccount](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/managed-serviceaccount)
* [application-manager](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicloud-operators-subscription)
* [config-policy-controller](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-addon-controller)
* [governance-policy-framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-addon-controller)

## Write your first add-on

Let's implement a simple add-on manager using addon-framework,  which deploys a busybox deployment in the managed cluster.
You can find the example in [here](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/cmd/busybox).

### Implement the addon manager

First, create your Go project, and the project should contain a `main.go` file and a folder `manifests`. The folder name 
can be customized, the example uses `manifests` as the folder name.`main.go` contains the Go code of the addon manager. 
`manifests` contains the addon agent's manifest files to be deployed on the managed cluster.

The `main.go` file is like this:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "embed"
  "os"
  restclient "k8s.io/client-go/rest"
  "k8s.io/klog/v2"
  "open-cluster-management.io/addon-framework/pkg/addonfactory"
  "open-cluster-management.io/addon-framework/pkg/addonmanager"
)

//go:embed manifests
var FS embed.FS

const (
  addonName = "busybox-addon"
)

func main() {
  kubeConfig, err := restclient.InClusterConfig()
  if err != nil {
     os.Exit(1)
  }
  addonMgr, err := addonmanager.New(kubeConfig)
  if err != nil {
     klog.Errorf("unable to setup addon manager: %v", err)
     os.Exit(1)
  }

  agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory(addonName, FS, "manifests").BuildTemplateAgentAddon()
  if err != nil {
     klog.Errorf("failed to build agent addon %v", err)
     os.Exit(1)
  }

  err = addonMgr.AddAgent(agentAddon)
  if err != nil {
     klog.Errorf("failed to add addon agent: %v", err)
     os.Exit(1)
  }

  ctx := context.Background()
  go addonMgr.Start(ctx)

  <-ctx.Done()
}
```

You need to define an `embed.FS` to embed the files in `manifests` folder.

And then you need to build an `agentAddon` using the `agentAddonFactory`, and tell the `agentAddonFactory` the name of 
the add-on and the agent manifests.

Finally, you just add the `agentAddon` to the `addonManager` and start the `addonManager`.

With above code, the addon manager is implemented. Next is to implement the addon agent part. In this example, the add-on agent 
manifest to be deployed on managed cluster is a busybox deployment.

Create file `deployment.yaml` in `manifests` folder, the `deployment.yaml` is like this: 

```
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
 name: busybox
 namespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
spec:
 replicas: 1
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     addon: busybox
 template:
   metadata:
     labels:
       addon: busybox
   spec:
     containers:
       - name: busybox
         image: busybox
         imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
         args:
           - "sleep"
           - "3600"
```

Then you can follow next section to [deploy the add-on manager on your hub cluster](##deploy-the-add-on-manager-on-your-hub-cluster). The add-on manager will watch the `ManagedClusterAddOn`, and deploy the add-on agent manifests to the targeted managed cluster via `ManifestWork`.

### Deploy the add-on manager on your hub cluster

Now you can build your add-on manager as an image and deploy it on the hub cluster. 

Following below steps to build the image for the [example](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/cmd/busybox). This image contains several example addon managers, including the busybox example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework.git
cd addon-framework
make images
```

In addition to the deployment definition, there are also some additional resources to be deployed on the hub cluster. An example of the deployment manifests for the add-on manager is [here](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/deploy/addon/busybox).
Following below steps to deploy the add-on manager.

```bash
make deploy-busybox
```

With the add-on manager deployed, you can see the `busybox-addon-controller` running in namespace `open-cluster-management` on the hub cluster.

```bash
$ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
busybox-addon-controller-d977665d5-x28qc   1/1     Running   0          27m
```

#### RBAC of the addon manager

There are some minimum required permissions for the addon manager controller to run on the hub cluster.  It needs to:

1. *get/list/watch/update* the `ManagedCluster`.
2. *get/list/watch/create/update/patch/delete* the `ManagedClusterAddOn` and `ManifestWork`.
3. *get/list/watch* the `ClusterManagementAddOn`.


#### ClusterManagementAddOn

From a userâ€™s perspective, to install the addon to the hub cluster the hub admin should register a globally-unique 
`ClusterManagementAddOn` resource as a singleton placeholder in the hub cluster. For instance, the [`ClusterManagementAddOn`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/blob/main/examples/deploy/addon/busybox/resources/busybox_clustermanagementaddon.yaml) 
for the busybox-addon:

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
metadata:
 name: busybox-addon
spec:
 addOnMeta:
   displayName: Busybox Addon
   description: "busybox-addon is an example addon to deploy busybox pod on the managed cluster"
```

### Enable the add-on for a managed cluster.

Now your addon-manager is running on the hub cluster. 
To deploy the busybox add-on agent to a certain managed cluster, you need to create a `ManagedClusterAddOn` in the 
managed cluster namespace of hub cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
 name: busybox-addon
 namespace: cluster1
spec:
 installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
```

You can set any existing namespace in the managed cluster as the `installNamespace` here, and the add-on manager will 
deploy the add-on agent manifests in this namespace of the managed cluster.

> Note: `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` is our default namespace to install the add-on agent manifests in the managed cluster.

You can also use the `clusteradm` command to enable the busybox-addon for the managed cluster.

```bash
$ clusteradm addon enable --names busybox-addon --namespace open-cluster-management-agent-addon --clusters cluster1
```

After enabling the add-on for the managed cluster, you can find a `ManifestWork` named `addon-busybox-addon-deploy` is 
deploying on the managed cluster namespace of the hub cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl get manifestworks.work.open-cluster-management.io -n cluster1
NAME                         AGE
addon-busybox-addon-deploy   2m
```

And the busybox deployment is deployed on the managed cluster too.

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
busybox                   1/1     1            1           2m
```

### Disable the add-on for a managed cluster

You can delete the `ManagedClusterAddOn` CR in the managed cluster namespace of the hub cluster to disable the add-on for 
the managed cluster.The created `ManifestWork` will be deleted and the add-on agent manifests will be removed from the 
managed cluster too.

You also can use the `clusteradm` command to disable the add-on for a managed cluster.

```bash
$ clusteradm addon disable --names busybox-addon --clusters cluster1
```

You can also use the `clusteradm` command to disable the add-ons for all managed clusters.

```bash
$ clusteradm addon disable --names busybox-addon --all-clusters true
```

If you delete the `ClusterManagementAddOn` on the hub cluster, the `ManagedClusterAddOn` CRs in all managed cluster 
namespaces will be deleted too.


### Whatâ€™s the next

However, this add-on just ensures a pod to run on the managed cluster, and you cannot see the status of the addon, 
and there are not any functionality to manage the clusters. The addon-framework also provides other configurations 
for add-on developers.

```bash
$ kubectl get managedclusteraddons.addon.open-cluster-management.io -n cluster1
NAME                AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
busybox-addon      Unknown
```

Next, you need to configure the addon.

## Add-on agent configurations

### Monitor addon healthiness

In the busybox example above, we found the `AVAILABLE` status of the `ManagedClusterAddOn` is always `Unknown`.

Thatâ€™s because the add-on manager did not monitor the status of the add-on agent from the hub cluster.

We support 3 kinds of health prober types to monitor the healthiness of add-on agents.

1. **Lease**

    The add-on agent maintains a `Lease` in its installation namespace with its status, the [registration agent](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/architecture/#registration) will 
    check this `Lease` to maintain the `AVAILABLE` status of the `ManagedClusterAddOn`.

    The addon-framework provides a [leaseUpdater]([https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/blob/main/pkg/lease/lease_controller.go#L24) interface which can make it easier.

    ```go
    leaseUpdater := lease.NewLeaseUpdater(spokeKubeClient, addonName, installNamespace)
    go leaseUpdater.Start(context.Background())
    ```

    `Lease` is the default prober type for add-on, there is nothing to configure for the add-on manager.

2. **Work**

    `Work` health prober indicates the healthiness of the add-on is equal to the overall dispatching status of the 
    corresponding the ManifestWork resources. It's applicable to those add-ons that don't have a container agent 
    in the managed clusters or don't expect to add `Lease` for the agent container. 
    The add-on manager will check if the work is `Available` on the managed clusters. 
    In addition, the user can define a `HealthCheck` prober function to check more detailed status based on status 
    feedback from the `ManifestWork`.

    It is required to define a `HealthProber` instance first. Here is an example to check if the `availableReplicas` of 
    add-on agent deployment is more than 1. If yes, it will set the `AVAILABLE` status of `ManagedClusterAddOn` to `true`. 
    Otherwise, the `AVAILABLE` status of `ManagedClusterAddOn` will be false.

    ```go
    healthProber := utils.NewDeploymentProber(types.NamespacedName{Name: "workprober-addon-agent", Namespace: "open-cluster-management-agent-addon"})
    ```
   
    And then you can configure the `HealthProber` to the agentAddon.

    ```go
    agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory(addonName, FS, "manifests").
                        WithAgentHealthProber(healthProber).
                        BuildTemplateAgentAddon()
    ```

3. **None**

    If you want to check and maintain the `AVAILABLE` status of `ManagedClusterAddOn` by yourself, set the type of `healthProber` to none.

    ```go
    healthProber := &agent.HealthProber{
        Type: agent.HealthProberTypeNone,
    }
    ```

### Automatic installation

In the busybox add-on example, you need to create a `ManagedClusterAddOn` CR to enable the add-on manually.  
The addon-framework also provides a configuration called `InstallStrategy` to support installing addon automatically.

Currently, the addon-framework supports `InstallAllStrategy` and `InstallByLabelStrategy` strategies.

`InstallAllStrategy` will create `ManagedClusterAddOn` for all managed cluster namespaces automatically.

```go
installStrategy := agent.InstallAllStrategy("open-cluster-management-agent-addon")
````

`InstallByLabelStrategy` will create `ManagedClusterAddOn` for the selected managed cluster namespaces automatically.

```go
installStrategy := &agent.InstallStrategy{
	Type:             agent.InstallByLabel,
    InstallNamespace: "open-cluster-management-agent-addon",
    LabelSelector:    &metav1.LabelSelector{...},
}
```

Configure the `InstallStrategy` to the agentAddon:

```go
agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory(addonName, FS, "manifests").
                    WithInstallStrategy(installStrategy).
                    BuildTemplateAgentAddon()
```

### Register your add-on

In most cases, the add-ons have requirements to access the hub cluster or other central service endpoint with TLS authentication. 
For example, an add-on agent needs to get a resource in its cluster namespace of the hub cluster, or the add-on agent 
needs to access the exposed service on the hub cluster.

The addon-framework supports a solution that the addon can access the `kube-apiserver` with a kube style API or 
other endpoints on the hub cluster with client certificate authentication after it is registered using `CSR`.

The addon-framework provides an interface to help add-on manager to save the add-on configuration information to 
its corresponding `ManagedClusterAddOns`.

On the managed cluster, the registration agent watches `ManagedClusterAddOns` on the hub cluster. 
The registration agent follows next steps to register an add-on:

1. The registration agent creates a `CSR` request with its own hub kubeConfig to register the add-on to the hub cluster.
2. On the hub cluster, the add-on manager approves the `CSR` request. The addon-framework also provides 
   an interface which the add-on manager can implement it to approve its `CSR` automatically.
3. After the `CSR` request is approved on the hub cluster, the registration agent gets the certificate from 
   the `CSR` request and saves the client certificate to a secret in the add-on agent install namespace.
   If the `SignerName` is `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`, the secret name will be `{addon name}-hub-kubeconfig`. 
   Otherwise, the secret name will be `{addon name}-{signer name}-client-cert`.
4. The add-on agent can mount the secret to get the client certificate to connect with the hub cluster or the custom service endpoint.
5. When the certificate of managed cluster addon is about to expire, the registration agent will send a request to 
   rotate the certificate on the hub cluster, the addon manager will approve the certificate rotation request.


Now we build another add-on that is going to sync configmap from the hub cluster to the managed cluster. 
The add-on code can be found [here](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/cmd/helloworld) .

Specifically, since the addon agent needs to read configmap from the hub, we need to define the registration option for this addon.

```go
func NewRegistrationOption(kubeConfig *rest.Config, addonName, agentName string) *agent.RegistrationOption {
    return &agent.RegistrationOption{
        CSRConfigurations: agent.KubeClientSignerConfigurations(addonName, agentName),
        CSRApproveCheck:   utils.DefaultCSRApprover(agentName),
        PermissionConfig:  rbac.AddonRBAC(kubeConfig),
    }
}
```

`CSRConfigurations` returns a list of `CSR` configuration for the addd-on agent in a managed cluster. The `CSR` will 
be created from the managed cluster for add-on agent with each `CSRConfiguration`.

```go
func KubeClientSignerConfigurations(addonName, agentName string) func(cluster *clusterv1.ManagedCluster) []addonapiv1alpha1.RegistrationConfig {
	return func(cluster *clusterv1.ManagedCluster) []addonapiv1alpha1.RegistrationConfig {
        return []addonapiv1alpha1.RegistrationConfig{
            {
                SignerName: certificatesv1.KubeAPIServerClientSignerName,
                Subject: addonapiv1alpha1.Subject{
                    User:   DefaultUser(cluster.Name, addonName, agentName),
                    Groups: DefaultGroups(cluster.Name, addonName),
                },
            },
        }
	}
}
```

The original Kubernetes `CSR` API only supports three built-in signers:

* kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
* kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet
* kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving

However, in some cases, we need to sign additional custom certificates for the add-on agents which are not used for connecting any kube-apiserver. 
The add-on manager can be serving as a custom `CSR` `signer` controller based on the addon-frameworkâ€™s extensibility by implementing the signing logic. 
The addon-framework will also keep rotating the certificates automatically for the add-on after successfully signing the certificates.

`CSRApproveCheck` checks whether the add-on agent registration should be approved by the add-on manager. 
The `utils.DefaultCSRApprover` is implemented to auto-approve all the `CSRs`. A better `CSR check` is recommended to include:

1. The validity of the requester's requesting identity.
2. The other request payload such as key-usages.

If the function is not set, the registration and certificate renewal of the add-on agent needs to be approved manually on the hub cluster.

`PermissionConfig` defines a function for an add-on to set up RBAC permissions on the hub cluster after the `CSR` is approved. 
In this example, it will create a role in the managed cluster namespace with *get/list/watch* configmaps permissions, 
and bind the role to the group defined in `CSRConfigurations`.

Configure the registrationOption to the agentAddon.

```go
agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory(helloworld.AddonName, helloworld.FS, "manifests/templates").
                    WithGetValuesFuncs(helloworld.GetValues, addonfactory.GetValuesFromAddonAnnotation).
                    WithAgentRegistrationOption(registrationOption).
                    WithInstallStrategy(addonagent.InstallAllStrategy(agent.HelloworldAgentInstallationNamespace)).
                    BuildTemplateAgentAddon()

```

After deploying the example add-on, you can find the registration configuration in the `ManagedClusterAddOn` status.

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: helloworld
  namespace: cluster1
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
    name: helloworld
spec:
  installNamespace: default
status:
  registrations:
  - signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
    subject:
      groups:
      - system:open-cluster-management:cluster:cluster1:addon:helloworld
      - system:open-cluster-management:addon:helloworld
      - system:authenticated
      user: system:open-cluster-management:cluster:cluster1:addon:helloworld:agent:2rn8d
```

In this example, the addon requires a `CSR` access hub kube-api (with singer name `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`).
After the `CSR` is created on the hub cluster, the add-on manager will check the signer, group and subject of the `CSRs` 
to verify whether the `CSR` is valid. If all fields are valid, the add-on manager will approve the `CSR`.

```yaml
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  labels:
    open-cluster-management.io/addon-name: helloworld
    open-cluster-management.io/cluster-name: cluster1
  name: addon-cluster1-helloworld-lb7cb
spec:
  groups:
  - system:open-cluster-management:cluster1
  - system:open-cluster-management:managed-clusters
  - system:authenticated
  request: xxx
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  usages:
  - digital signature
  - key encipherment
  - client auth
  username: system:open-cluster-management:cluster1:9bkfw
```

After the `CSR` is approved, the add-on controller creates the `Role` and `Rolebinding` in the cluster namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl get role -n cluster1
NAME                                       CREATED AT
open-cluster-management:helloworld:agent   2022-07-10T10:08:37Z
$ kubectl get rolebinding -n cluster1
NAME                                                           ROLE                                                              AGE
open-cluster-management:helloworld:agent                       Role/open-cluster-management:helloworld:agent                     13m
```

The `Rolebinding` binds the `Role` to the Group `system:open-cluster-management:cluster:cluster1:addon:helloworld`.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: open-cluster-management:helloworld:agent
  namespace: cluster1
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: open-cluster-management:helloworld:agent
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:open-cluster-management:cluster:cluster1:addon:helloworld
```

The registration agent will create a kubeConfig secret named `<add-on name>-hub-kubeconfig` in the `addonInstallNamesapce`. 
The addon agent can mount the secret to get the hub kubeConfig to connect with the hub cluster to *get/list/watch* the Configmaps.

```bash
$ kubectl get secret -n default
NAME                              TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
helloworld-hub-kubeconfig         Opaque                                3      9m52s
```

### Add your add-on agent supported configurations 

For some cases, you want to specify the configurations for your add-on agent, for example, you may want to use a configuration to configure your add-on agent image or use a configuration to configure your add-on agent node Selector and tolerations to make the agent to run on specific nodes.

The addon-framework supports re-rendering the add-on agent deployment when the add-on agent configurations are changed.

You can choose the [`AddOnDeploymentConfig`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/addon/v1alpha1/types_addondeploymentconfig.go) API as the configuration for your add-on agent, it supports setting customized variables and node placement for your add-on agent deployment, and meanwhile you can also choose your own configuration.

You can do the following steps to reference your configurations in your add-on APIs with add-on framework

1. Add the supported configuration types in your add-on `ClusterManagementAddOn`, we support to add mutiple different configuration types in the `ClusterManagementAddOn`, for example

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
    metadata:
      name: helloworldhelm
    spec:
      # the add-on supported configurations
      supportedConfigs:
      - group: addon.open-cluster-management.io
        resource: addondeploymentconfigs
      - resource: configmaps
    ```

   In this example, the `helloworldhelm` add-on supports using `AddOnDeploymentConfig` and `ConfigMap` as its configuration, and you can specify one default configuration for one configuration type, for example

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
    metadata:
      name: helloworldhelm
    spec:
      # the add-on supported configurations
      supportedConfigs:
      - group: addon.open-cluster-management.io
        resource: addondeploymentconfigs
        # the default config for helloworldhelm 
        defaultConfig:
          name: deploy-config
          namespace: open-cluster-management
      - resource: configmaps
   ```

   Thus, all helloworldhelm add-ons on each managed cluster have one same default configuration `open-cluster-management/deploy-config`

2. Register the supported configuration types when building one `AgentAddon` with `AgentAddonFactory`

3. Implement a `GetValuesFunc` to transform the configuration to add-on framework `Values` object and add the `GetValuesFunc` to the `AgentAddonFactory`, for example

    ```go
    agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory("helloworldhelm", helloworld_helm.FS, "manifests/charts/helloworld").
        // register the supported configuration types
        WithConfigGVRs(
          schema.GroupVersionResource{Version: "v1", Resource: "configmaps"},
          schema.GroupVersionResource{Group: "addon.open-cluster-management.io", Version: "v1alpha1", Resource: "addondeploymentconfigs"},
        ).
        WithGetValuesFuncs(
          // get the AddOnDeloymentConfig object and transform it to Values object
          addonfactory.GetAddOnDeloymentConfigValues(
            addonfactory.NewAddOnDeloymentConfigGetter(addonClient),
            addonfactory.ToAddOnNodePlacementValues,
          ),
          // get the ConfigMap object and transform it to Values object
          helloworld_helm.GetImageValues(kubeClient),
        ).WithAgentRegistrationOption(registrationOption).
        BuildHelmAgentAddon()
    ```

    In this example, we register the `ConfigMap` and `AddOnDeploymentConfig` as the `helloworldhelm` add-on configuration. We use add-on framework
    help function [`GetAddOnDeloymentConfigValues`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/blob/main/pkg/addonfactory/addondeploymentconfig.go#L47) to transform the `AddOnDeploymentConfig`, and we implemented the [`GetImageValues`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/blob/main/examples/helloworld_helm/helloworld_helm.go#L64) function to
    transform the `ConfigMap`, you can find more details for add-on framework `Values` from the [Values definition](#values-definition) part.

4. Add the `get`, `list` and `watch` permissions to an add-on `clusterrole`, for example, the [clusterrole](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/blob/main/examples/deploy/addon/helloworld-helm/resources/cluster_role.yaml) of `helloworldhelm` should have the following permissions

  ```yaml
  kind: ClusterRole
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: helloworldhelm-addon
  rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["configmaps"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    - apiGroups: ["addon.open-cluster-management.io"]
      resources: ["addondeploymentconfigs"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  ```

To configure add-on, the add-on user need reference their configuration objects in `ManagedClusterAddOn`, for example

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: helloworldhelm
  namespace: cluster1
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
  configs:
  - group: addon.open-cluster-management.io
    resource: addondeploymentconfigs
    name: deploy-config
    namespace: cluster1
  - resource: configmaps 
    name: image-config
    namespace: cluster1
```

In this example, the add-on user reference the configuration `cluster1/deploy-config` and `cluster1/image-config` for `helloworldhelm` on `cluster1`. When the configuration references are added to an add-on, the add-on framework will show them in the status of `ManagedClusterAddOn` and render the add-on once, during the rendering process, the add-on framework will callback the `GetValuesFunc`s to transform the add-on configuraton object to add-on framework `Values` object and use `Values` object to render the add-on agent deployment resources. If the add-on configuration objects are updated, the add-on framework will render the add-on again. 

## Build an addon using helm charts or raw manifests.

### Building steps

The addon-framework supports helm charts or raw manifests as the add-on agent manifests. The building steps are the same:

1. Copy the helm chart or raw manifests files into the add-on manager project. And define an `embed.FS` to embed the files 
   into your Go program.

   The example using helm chart is [helloworld_helm addon](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/helloworld_helm), 
   and the example using raw manifests is [helloworld addon](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/helloworld).

2. Build different `agentAddons` using the `agentAddonFactory` instance with `BuildHelmAgentAddon` or `BuildTemplateAgentAddon`.

   For helm chart building:

    ```go
    agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory(helloworld_helm.AddonName, helloworld_helm.FS, "manifests/charts/helloworld").
                        WithGetValuesFuncs(helloworld_helm.GetValues, addonfactory.GetValuesFromAddonAnnotation).
                        WithAgentRegistrationOption(registrationOption).
                        BuildHelmAgentAddon()
    ```
   
    For raw manifests building:

    ```go
    agentAddon, err := addonfactory.NewAgentAddonFactory(helloworld.AddonName, helloworld.FS, "manifests/templates").
                        WithGetValuesFuncs(helloworld.GetValues, addonfactory.GetValuesFromAddonAnnotation).
                        WithAgentRegistrationOption(registrationOption).
                        WithInstallStrategy(addonagent.InstallAllStrategy(agent.HelloworldAgentInstallationNamespace)).
                        BuildTemplateAgentAddon()
    ```

3. Add the agentAddon to the addon manager.
4. Start the addon manager.

### Values definition

The addon-framework supports 3 add-on built-in values and 3 helm chart built-in values for helm chart add-on manifests.

* `Value.clusterName`
* `Value.addonInstallNamespace`
* `Value.hubKubeConfigSecret` (used when the add-on is needed to register to the hub cluster)
* `Capabilities.KubeVersion` is the `ManagedCluster.Status.Version.Kubernetes`.
* `Release.Name`  is the add-on name.
* `Release.Namespace` is the `addonInstallNamespace`.

The addon-framework supports 3 add-on built-in values in the config of templates for the raw manifests add-on.

* `ClusterName`
* `AddonInstallNamespace`
* `HubKubeConfigSecret` (used when the AddOn is needed to register to the hub cluster)

In the list of `GetValuesFuncs`, the values from the big index Func will override the one from low index Func.

The built-in values will override the values obtained from the list of `GetValuesFuncs`.

The Variable names in Values should begin with lowercase. So the best practice is to define a json struct for the values, 
and convert it to Values using the `JsonStructToValues`.

Values from annotation of `ManagedClusterAddOn`

The addon-framework supports a helper `GetValuesFunc` named `GetValuesFromAddonAnnotation` which can get values from 
the annotations of `ManagedClusterAddOn`.

The key of the Helm Chart values in annotation is `addon.open-cluster-management.io/values`,
and the value should be a valid json string which has key-value format.

### Hosted mode

The addon-framework supports add-on in Hosted mode, that the agent manifests will be deployed outside the managed cluster.
We can choose to run add-on in Hosted mode or Default mode if the managed cluster is imported to the hub in Hosted mode.
By default, the add-on agent will run on the managed cluster(Default mode).
We can add an annotation `addon.open-cluster-management.io/hosting-cluster-name` for the `ManagedClusterAddon`,
so that the add-on agent will be deployed on the certain hosting cluster(Hosted mode), 
the value of the annotation is the hosting cluster which should:

* be a managed cluster of the hub as well.
* be the same cluster where the managed cluster `klusterlet`(registration-agent & work-agent) runs.

We defined a label `addon.open-cluster-management.io/hosted-manifest-location` to indicate which cluster the add-on 
agent manifests should be deployed.

* No matter what the value is, all manifests will be deployed on the managed cluster in Default mode.
* When the label does not exist or the value is `managed`: the manifest will be deployed on the managed cluster in Hosted mode.
* When the value is `hosting`: the manifest will be deployed on the hosting cluster in Hosted mode.
* When the value is `none`: the manifest will not be deployed in Hosted mode.

More details you can find in the [design](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/enhancements/tree/main/enhancements/sig-architecture/63-hosted-addon), 
and we have an example in [here](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/helloworld_hosted).

## Pre-delete hook

The addon-framework provides a hook manifest before delete the add-on. 
The hook manifest supports `Jobs` or `Pods` to do some cleanup work before the add-on agent is deleted on the managed cluster.

You need only add the label `open-cluster-management.io/addon-pre-delete` to the `Jobs` or `Pods`in the add-on manifests. 
The `Jobs` or `Pods` will not be applied until the `ManagedClusterAddOn` is deleted. 
And the `Jobs` or `Pods` will be applied on the managed cluster by applying the manifestWork named `addon-<addon name>-pre-delete` 
when the `ManagedClusterAddOn` is under deleting. 
After the `Jobs` are `Completed` or `Pods` are in the `Succeeded` phase, all the deployed `ManifestWorks` will be deleted.

You can find the example from [here](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/tree/main/examples/helloworld_helm).

## What happened under the scene

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 20px;">
   <img src="/addon-architecture.png" alt="Addon Architecture" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 80%">
</div>


This architecture graph shows how the coordination between add-on manager and add-on agent works.

1. The registration agent creates a `CSR` request with its own hub kubeConfig to register the add-on to the hub cluster.
2. On the hub cluster, the add-on manager approves the `CSR` request.
3. After the `CSR` request is approved on the hub cluster, the registration agent gets the certificate from the `CSR` request 
   to establish the hub kubeConfig and save the hub kubeConfig to a secret in the managed cluster addon namespace.
4. The add-on manager is watching the `ManagedClusterAddOn` for all managed cluster namespaces. 
   And will create an add-on deploy `ManifestWork` in the managed cluster namespace once the `ManagedClusterAddOn` is created in this managed cluster namespace.
5. The work agent will apply the manifests in the `ManifestWork` on the managed cluster.
6. The add-on agent will mount the secret created by the registration agent to get the hub kubeConfig to connect with the hub cluster.
