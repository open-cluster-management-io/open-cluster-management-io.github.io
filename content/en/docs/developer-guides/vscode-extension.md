The OCM [VScode Extension][vscode-ext-git-repo] is a UI tool for OCM related Kubernetes resources.
The extension has been built upon Visual Studio Code and offers additional OCM administrative and monitoring features in order to improve operational efficiency and accelerate development within engineering teams.
The OCM VScode Extension provides tons of useful features, including easy to generate OCM related Kubernetes resources, automated local OCM environment creation and a simple and convenient monitoring view for cluster resources.
Having an effective UI tool for managing your cluster is key to a healthy environment. With the right user interface, you can administer changes to the cluster, track resources, and troubleshoot issues more efficiently, without having to use numerous additional CLI tools.

* To Manage Existing Resources ensure [`kubectl`][install-kubectl] is installed.

* To Create Local Environment ensure [`kind`][install-kind], [`kubectl`][install-kubectl] and [`clusteradm`][install-clusteradm] are all installed.

* To load Resources Snippets or create a Bootstrap Project no additional prerequisites are needed

## Installation

### Install Latest version
In your VScode instance, go to the Extensions Marketplace (by clicking on the _Extensions_ icon in the composite bar on the left hand side or simply typing Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for _OCM Extension_ and click install.

### Create Local Environment

The Create Local Environment feature allows you to create a quick OCM multi-cluster control plane on a local [kind][kind] environment with only a click of a button.

The feature does it all for you:
  - Verifies the existence of the required tools.
  - Creates as many [kind][kind] clusters as you need (customizable).
  - Initializes the _hub cluster_ by installing a [Cluster Manager][cluster-manager] using [clusteradm][clusteradm], and [kubectl][install-kubectl].
  - Installs a [Klusterlet][klusterlet] agent on the _managed clusters_ and sends join requests to the _hub cluster_ using [clusteradm][clusteradm], and [kubectl][install-kubectl].
  - Accepts the join requests from the _hub cluster_ using [clusteradm][clusteradm], and [kubectl][install-kubectl].

To exercise this feature you must take the following steps:
  1. Click on the _OCM_ icon in the composite bar on the left hand side to open the VScode Extension control pane
  2. Locate the _Create Local Environment_ button in the _Developers Tools_ section and give it a click
  3. Notice that at the top of your screen an action container will prompt you to choose between default or custom configuration
  4. After configuration was specified, a progress bar at the botom right of your screen will provide feadback on the build process

    * Clicking on the _OCM_ icon in the composite bar on the left hand side to open the VScode Extension control pane, locating the _Connected Clusters_ section and selecting any cluster in the list
  2. Inside the _Cluster Details_ tab, use the dropdown to select any cluster from the list of availabe clusters in order to view the resources within it
