## Application console (work in progress)

The _Application console_ includes a dashboard for managing the application lifecycle. You can use the console dashboard to create and manage applications and view the status of applications. Enhanced capabilities help your developers and operations personnel create, deploy, update, manage, and visualize applications across your clusters.

For more information, see the 
[_Application console_](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.2/html/manage_applications/managing-applications#application-console) documentation.
