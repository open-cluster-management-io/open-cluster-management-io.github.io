**API-CHANGE NOTE**:
`Placement` and `PlacementDecision` API is upgraded from v1alpha1 to v1beta1,
v1alpha1 will be deprecated in OCM v0.7.0 and planned to be removed in OCM
v0.8.0. The field `spec.prioritizerPolicy.configurations.name` in `Placement`
API v1alpha1 is removed and replaced by
`spec.prioritizerPolicy.configurations.scoreCoordinate.builtIn` in v1beta1.


## Overall

`Placement` concept is used to dynamically select a set of managed clusters in
one or multiple [ManagedClusterSet](../managedclusterset) so that higher level
users can either replicate Kubernetes resources to the member clusters or run
their advanced workload i.e. __multi-cluster scheduling__.

The "input" and "output" of the scheduling process are decoupled into two
separated Kubernetes API `Placement` and `PlacementDecision`. As is shown in
the following picture, we prescribe the scheduling policy in the spec of
`Placement` API and the placement controller in the hub will help us to
dynamically select a slice of managed clusters from the given cluster sets.

Note that the scheduling result in the `PlacementDecision` API is designed to
be paginated with its page index as the name's suffix to avoid "too large
object" issue from the underlying Kubernetes API framework.

</div>


Following the architecture of Kubernetes' original scheduling framework, the
multi-cluster scheduling is logically divided into two phases internally:

- __Predicate__: Hard requirements for the selected clusters.
- __Prioritize__: Rank the clusters by the soft requirements and select a subset
  among them.

## Select clusters in ManagedClusterSet

By following [the previous section](../managedclusterset) about
`ManagedClusterSet`, now we're supposed to have one or multiple valid cluster
sets in the hub clusters. Then we can move on and create a placement in the
"workspace namespace" by specifying `predicates` and `prioritizers` in the
`Placement` API to define our own multi-cluster scheduling policy.

### Predicates

#### Label/Claim selection

In the `predicates` section, you can select clusters by labels or `clusterClaims`.
For instance, you can select 3 clusters with labels `purpose=test` and
clusterClaim `platform.open-cluster-management.io=aws` as seen in the following
examples:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement1
  namespace: default
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 3
  clusterSets:
    - prod
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            purpose: test
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: platform.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - aws
```

Note that the distinction between label-selecting and claim-selecting is
elaborated in [this page](https://open-cluster-management.io/scenarios/extending-managed-clusters/)
about how to extend attributes for the managed clusters.

#### Taints/Tolerations

To support filtering unhealthy/not-reporting clusters and keep workloads from
being placed in unhealthy or unreachable clusters, we introduce the similar
concept of taint/toleration in Kubernetes. It also allows user to add a
customized taint to deselect a cluster from placement. This is useful when the
user wants to set a cluster to maintenance mode and evict workload from this
cluster.

In OCM, Taints and Tolerations work together to allow users to control the
selection of managed clusters more flexibly.

[Taints](../managedcluster/#cluster-taints-and-tolerations) are properties of
ManagedClusters, they allow a Placement to repel a set of ManagedClusters in
predicates stage.

Tolerations are applied to Placements, and allow Placements to select
ManagedClusters with matching taints. In `tolerations` section, it includes the
following fields:
- __Key__ (optional). Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to.
- __Value__ (optional). Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
- __Operator__ (optional). Operator represents a key's relationship to the
value. Valid operators are `Exists` and `Equal`. Defaults to `Equal`. A
toleration "matches" a taint if the keys are the same and the effects are the
same, and the operator is:
  - `Equal`. The operator is Equal and the values are equal.
  - `Exists`. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a placement
  can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
- __Effect__ (optional). Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means
match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are `NoSelect`,
`PreferNoSelect` and `NoSelectIfNew`.
- __TolerationSeconds__ (optional). TolerationSeconds represents the period of
time the toleration (which must be of effect `NoSelect`/`PreferNoSelect`,
otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. The default value is nil,
which indicates it tolerates the taint forever. The start time of counting the
TolerationSeconds should be the `TimeAdded` in Taint, not the cluster scheduled
time or `TolerationSeconds` added time.

The following example shows how to tolerate clusters with taints.

- Tolerate clusters with taint

Suppose your managed cluster has taint added as below, 
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  taints:
    - effect: NoSelect
      key: gpu
      value: "true"
      timeAdded: '2022-02-21T08:11:06Z'
```

By default, the placement won’t select this cluster unless you define
tolerations,
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement1
  namespace: default
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: gpu
      value: "true"
      operator: Equal
```
With the above tolerations defined, cluster1 could be selected by placement
because of the `key: gpu` and `value: "true"` match.

- Tolerate clusters with taint for a period of time

`TolerationSeconds` represents the period of time the toleration tolerates the
taint. It could be used for the case like, when a managed cluster gets offline,
users can make applications deployed on this cluster to be transferred to
another available managed cluster after a tolerated time. 

  For example, suppose the managed cluster becomes unreachable,
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: cluster1
spec:
  hubAcceptsClient: true
  taints:
    - effect: NoSelect
      key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      timeAdded: '2022-02-21T08:11:06Z'
```

  If define a placement with TolerationSeconds as below, then the workload will
  transferred to another available managed cluster after 5 minutes.
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: demo4
  namespace: demo1
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/unreachable
      operator: Exists
      tolerationSeconds: 300
```

### Prioritizers


#### Score-based prioritizer

In `prioritizerPolicy` section, you can define the policy of prioritizers.
For instance, you can select 2 clusters with the largest memory available and
the largest addon score cpuratio, and pin the placementdecisions as seen in the
following examples.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement1
  namespace: default
spec:
  numberOfClusters: 2
  prioritizerPolicy:
    mode: Exact
    configurations:
      - scoreCoordinate:
          builtIn: ResourceAllocatableMemory
      - scoreCoordinate:
          builtIn: Steady
        weight: 3
      - scoreCoordinate:
          type: AddOn
          addOn:
            resourceName: default
            scoreName: cpuratio
```

- `mode` is either `Exact`, `Additive`, `""` where `""` is Additive by default.
    - In `Additive` mode, any prioritizer not explicitly enumerated is enabled
    in its default Configurations, in which Steady and Balance prioritizers have
    the weight of 1 while other prioritizers have the weight of 0. Additive
    doesn't require configuring all prioritizers. The default Configurations may
    change in the future, and additional prioritization will happen.
    - In `Exact` mode, any prioritizer not explicitly enumerated is weighted as
    zero. Exact requires knowing the full set of prioritizers you want, but
    avoids behavior changes between releases.
- `configurations` represents the configuration of prioritizers.
    - `scoreCoordinate` represents the configuration of the prioritizer and
    score source.
        - `type` defines the type of the prioritizer score.
          Type is either "BuiltIn", "AddOn" or "", where "" is "BuiltIn" by
          default.
          When the type is "BuiltIn", a BuiltIn prioritizer name must be
          specified.
          When the type is "AddOn", need to configure the score source in AddOn.
        - `builtIn` defines the name of a BuiltIn prioritizer. Below are the
        valid BuiltIn prioritizer names.
            - Balance: balance the decisions among the clusters.
            - Steady: ensure the existing decision is stabilized.
            - ResourceAllocatableCPU & ResourceAllocatableMemory: sort clusters
            based on the allocatable.
        - `addOn` defines the resource name and score name.
        `AddOnPlacementScore` is introduced to describe addon scores, go into
        the [Extensible scheduling](#extensible-scheduling) section to learn
        more about it.
            - `resourceName` defines the resource name of the
            `AddOnPlacementScore`. The placement prioritizer selects
            `AddOnPlacementScore` CR by this name.
            - `scoreName` defines the score name inside `AddOnPlacementScore`.
            `AddOnPlacementScore` contains a list of score name and score value,
            ScoreName specifies the score to be used by the prioritizer.
    - `weight` defines the weight of the prioritizer. The value must be ranged in
    [-10,10].
      Each prioritizer will calculate an integer score of a cluster in the range
      of [-100, 100]. The final score of a cluster will be sum(weight *
      prioritizer_score).
      A higher weight indicates that the prioritizer weights more in the cluster
      selection, while 0 weight indicates that the prioritizer is disabled. A
      negative weight indicates wanting to select the last ones.
      
A slice of `PlacementDecision` will be created by placement controller in the
same namespace, each with a label of
`cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}`.
`PlacementDecision` contains the results of the cluster selection as seen in the
following examples.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: PlacementDecision
metadata:
  labels:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement: placement1
  name: placement1-decision-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  decisions:
    - clusterName: cluster1
    - clusterName: cluster2
    - clusterName: cluster3
```

`PlacementDecision` can be consumed by another operand to decide how the
workload should be placed in multiple clusters.

## Extensible scheduling
In placement resource based scheduling, in some cases the prioritizer needs
extra data (more than the default value provided by ManagedCluster) to calculate
the score of the managed cluster. For example, schedule the clusters based on
cpu or memory usage data of the clusters fetched from a monitoring system.

So we provide a new API `AddOnPlacementScore` to support a more extensible way
to schedule based on customized scores.
- As a user, as mentioned in the above section, can specify the score in
placement yaml to select clusters.
- As a score provider, a 3rd party controller could run on either hub or managed
cluster, to maintain the lifecycle of `AddOnPlacementScore` and update score
into it.

Refer to the
[enhancements](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/enhancements/blob/main/enhancements/sig-architecture/32-extensiblescheduling/32-extensiblescheduling.md)
to learn more.

## Future work

In addition to selecting cluster by predicates, we are still working on other
advanced features including

- [Various workload spread
policies](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/issues/49).
- [Usage based
scheduling](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/issues/52).
