The policy framework has the following API concepts:

- [_Policy Templates_](#managed-cluster-policy-controllers) are the policies that perform a desired check or action. For
  example,
  [ConfigurationPolicy]({{< ref "/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers#install-the-configuration-policy-controller" >}})
  objects are embedded in `Policy` objects under the `policy-templates` array.
- A [`Policy`](#policy) is a grouping mechanism for _Policy Templates_ and is the smallest deployable unit on the hub
  cluster. Embedded _Policy Templates_ are distributed to applicable managed clusters and acted upon by the appropriate
  [policy controller]({{< ref "/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers" >}}).
- A [`PolicySet`](#policyset) is a grouping mechanism of `Policy` objects. Compliance of all grouped `Policy` objects is
  summarized in the `PolicySet`. A `PolicySet` is a deployable unit and its distribution is controlled by a
  [Placement]({{< ref "/concepts/placement" >}}).
- A [`PlacementBinding`](#placementbinding) binds a [Placement]({{< ref "/concepts/placement" >}}) to a `Policy` or `PolicySet`.

The second half of the
[KubeCon NA 2022 - OCM Multicluster App & Config Management](/kubecon-na-2022-ocm-multicluster-app-and-config-management.pdf)
also covers an overview of the Policy addon.

## Policy

A `Policy` is a grouping mechanism for _Policy Templates_ and is the smallest deployable unit on the hub cluster.
Embedded _Policy Templates_ are distributed to applicable managed clusters and acted upon by the appropriate
[policy controller]({{< ref "/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers" >}}). The compliance state and status of a `Policy`
represents all embedded _Policy Templates_ in the `Policy`. The distribution of `Policy` objects is controlled by a
[Placement]({{< ref "/concepts/placement" >}}).

View a simple example of a `Policy` that embeds a `ConfigurationPolicy` policy template to manage a namespace called
"prod".

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy-namespace
  namespace: policies
  annotations:
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards: NIST SP 800-53
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/categories: CM Configuration Management
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/controls: CM-2 Baseline Configuration
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  disabled: false
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          name: policy-namespace-example
        spec:
          remediationAction: inform
          severity: low
          object-templates:
            - complianceType: musthave
              objectDefinition:
                kind: Namespace # must have namespace 'prod'
                apiVersion: v1
                metadata:
                  name: prod
```

The `annotations` are standard annotations for informational purposes and can be used by user interfaces, custom report
scripts, or components that integrate with OCM.

The optional `spec.remediationAction` field dictates whether the policy controller should `inform` or `enforce` when
violations are found and overrides the `remediationAction` field on each policy template. When set to `inform`, the
`Policy` will become noncompliant if the underlying policy templates detect that the desired state is not met. When set
to `enforce`, the policy controller applies the desired state when necessary and feasible.

The `policy-templates` array contains an array of [_Policy Templates_](#managed-cluster-policy-controllers). Here a
single `ConfigurationPolicy` called `policy-namespace-example` defines a `Namespace` manifest to compare with objects on
the cluster. It has the `remediationAction` set to `inform` but it is overridden by the optional global
`spec.remediationAction`. The `severity` is for informational purposes similar to the `annotations`.

Inside of the embedded `ConfigurationPolicy`, the `object-templates` section describes the `prod` `Namespace` object
that the `ConfigurationPolicy` applies to. The action that the `ConfigurationPolicy` will take is determined by the
`complianceType`. In this case, it is set to `musthave` which means the `prod` `Namespace` object will be created if it
doesn't exist. Other compliance types include `mustnothave` and `mustonlyhave`. `mustnothave` would delete the `prod`
`Namespace` object. `mustonlyhave` would ensure the `prod` `Namespace` object only exists with the fields defined in the
`ConfigurationPolicy`. See the
[`ConfigurationPolicy` page]({{< ref "/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers/configuration-policy" >}}) for more information
or see the [templating in configuration policies](#templating-in-configuration-policies) topic for advanced templating
use cases with `ConfigurationPolicy`.

When the `Policy` is bound to a [`Placement`]({{< ref "/concepts/placement" >}}) using a [`PlacementBinding`](#placementbinding), the
`Policy` status will report on each cluster that matches the bound `Placement`:

```yaml
status:
  compliant: Compliant
  placement:
    - placement: placement-hub-cluster
      placementBinding: binding-policy-namespace
  status:
    - clustername: local-cluster
      clusternamespace: local-cluster
      compliant: Compliant
```

To fully explore the `Policy` API, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get crd policies.policy.open-cluster-management.io -o yaml
```

To fully explore the `ConfigurationPolicy` API, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get crd configurationpolicies.policy.open-cluster-management.io -o yaml
```

## PlacementBinding

A `PlacementBinding` binds a [Placement]({{< ref "/concepts/placement" >}}) to a [`Policy`](#policy) or [`PolicySet`](#policyset).

Below is an example of a `PlacementBinding` that binds the `policy-namespace` `Policy` to the `placement-hub-cluster`
`Placement`.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-policy-namespace
  namespace: policies
placementRef:
  apiGroup: cluster.open-cluster-management.io
  kind: Placement
  name: placement-hub-cluster
subjects:
  - apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
    kind: Policy
    name: policy-namespace
```

Once the `Policy` is bound, it will be distributed to and acted upon by the managed clusters that match the `Placement`.

## PolicySet

A `PolicySet` is a grouping mechanism of [`Policy`](#policy) objects. Compliance of all grouped `Policy` objects is
summarized in the `PolicySet`. A `PolicySet` is a deployable unit and its distribution is controlled by a
[Placement]({{< ref "/concepts/placement" >}}) when bound through a [`PlacementBinding`](#placementbinding).

This enables a workflow where subject matter experts write `Policy` objects and then an IT administrator creates a
`PolicySet` that groups the previously written `Policy` objects and binds the `PolicySet` to a `Placement` that deploys
the `PolicySet`.

An example of a `PolicySet` is shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: PolicySet
metadata:
  name: acm-hardening
  namespace: policies
spec:
  description: Apply standard best practices for hardening your Open Cluster Management installation.
  policies:
    - policy-check-backups
    - policy-managedclusteraddon-available
    - policy-subscriptions
```

## Managed cluster policy controllers

The [`Policy`](#policy) on the hub delivers the policies defined in `spec.policy-templates` to the managed clusters via
the policy framework controllers. Once on the managed cluster, these _Policy Templates_ are acted upon by the associated
controller on the managed cluster. The policy framework supports delivering the _Policy Template_ kinds listed here:

- Configuration policy

  The `ConfigurationPolicy` is provided by OCM and defines Kubernetes manifests to compare with objects that currently
  exist on the cluster. The action that the `ConfigurationPolicy` will take is determined by its `complianceType`.
  Compliance types include `musthave`, `mustnothave`, and `mustonlyhave`. `musthave` means the object should have the
  listed keys and values as a subset of the larger object. `mustnothave` means an object matching the listed keys and
  values should not exist. `mustonlyhave` ensures objects only exist with the keys and values exactly as defined. See
  the page on [Configuration Policy]({{< ref "/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers/configuration-policy" >}}) for more
  information.

- Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper

  Gatekeeper is a validating webhook with auditing capabilities that can enforce custom resource definition-based
  policies that are run with the Open Policy Agent (OPA). Gatekeeper `ConstraintTemplates` and constraints can be
  provided in an OCM `Policy` to sync to managed clusters that have Gatekeeper installed on them. See the page on
  [Gatekeeper integration]({{< ref "/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers/gatekeeper" >}}) for more information.

## Templating in configuration policies

Configuration policies support the inclusion of Golang text templates in the object definitions. These templates are
resolved at runtime either on the hub cluster or the target managed cluster using configurations related to that
cluster. This gives you the ability to define configuration policies with dynamic content and to inform or enforce
Kubernetes resources that are customized to the target cluster.

The template syntax must follow the Golang template language specification, and the resource definition generated from
the resolved template must be a valid YAML. (See the
[Golang documentation about package templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) for more information.) Any errors
in template validation appear as policy violations. When you use a custom template function, the values are replaced at
runtime.

Template functions, such as resource-specific and generic `lookup` template functions, are available for referencing
Kubernetes resources on the hub cluster (using the `{{hub ... hub}}` delimiters), or managed cluster (using the
`{{ ... }}` delimiters). See the [Hub cluster templates section](#hub-cluster-templates) for more details. The
resource-specific functions are used for convenience and makes content of the resources more accessible. If you use the
generic function, `lookup`, which is more advanced, it is best to be familiar with the YAML structure of the resource
that is being looked up. In addition to these functions, utility functions like `base64encode`, `base64decode`,
`indent`, `autoindent`, `toInt`, and `toBool` are also available.

To conform templates with YAML syntax, templates must be set in the policy resource as strings using quotes or a block
character (`|` or `>`). This causes the resolved template value to also be a string. To override this, consider using
`toInt` or `toBool` as the final function in the template to initiate further processing that forces the value to be
interpreted as an integer or boolean respectively.

To bypass template processing you can either:

- Override a single template by wrapping the template in additional braces. For example, the template
  `{{ template content }}` would become `{{ '{{ template content }}' }}`.
- Override all templates in a `ConfigurationPolicy` by adding the
  `policy.open-cluster-management.io/disable-templates: "true"` annotation in the `ConfigurationPolicy` section of your
  `Policy`. Template processing will be bypassed for that `ConfigurationPolicy`.

### Hub cluster templating in configuration policies

Hub cluster templates are used to define configuration policies that are dynamically customized to the target cluster.
This reduces the need to create separate policies for each target cluster or hardcode configuration values in the policy
definitions.

Hub cluster templates are based on Golang text template specifications, and the `{{hub … hub}}` delimiter indicates a
hub cluster template in a configuration policy.

A configuration policy definition can contain both hub cluster and managed cluster templates. Hub cluster templates are
processed first on the hub cluster, then the policy definition with resolved hub cluster templates is propagated to the
target clusters. On the managed cluster, the Configuration Policy controller processes any managed cluster templates in
the policy definition and then enforces or verifies the fully resolved object definition.

In OCM versions 0.9.x and older, policies are processed on the hub cluster only upon creation or after an update.
Therefore, hub cluster templates are only resolved to the data in the referenced resources upon policy creation or
update. Any changes to the referenced resources are not automatically synced to the policies.

A special annotation, `policy.open-cluster-management.io/trigger-update` can be used to indicate changes to the data
referenced by the templates. Any change to the special annotation value initiates template processing, and the latest
contents of the referenced resource are read and updated in the policy definition that is the propagator for processing
on managed clusters. A typical way to use this annotation is to increment the value by one each time.

### Templating value encryption

The encryption algorithm uses AES-CBC with 256-bit keys. Each encryption key is unique per managed cluster and is
automatically rotated every 30 days. This ensures that your decrypted value is never stored in the policy on the managed
cluster.

To force an immediate encryption key rotation, delete the `policy.open-cluster-management.io/last-rotated` annotation on
the `policy-encryption-key` Secret in the managed cluster namespace on the hub cluster. Policies are then reprocessed to
use the new encryption key.

| `indent`           | Returns the input string indented by the given number of spaces.                                                                                                                                                    | `Ca-cert: \|`<br />`{{ ( index ( lookup "v1" "Secret" "default" "mycert-tls" ).data "ca.pem" ) \| base64dec \| indent 4 }}`                  |
| `autoindent`       | Acts like the `indent` function but automatically determines the number of leading spaces needed based on the number of spaces before the template.                                                                 | `Ca-cert: \|`<br />`{{ ( index ( lookup "v1" "Secret" "default" "mycert-tls" ).data "ca.pem" ) \| base64dec \| autoindent }}`                |
| `toInt`            | Returns the integer value of the string and ensures that the value is interpreted as an integer in the YAML.                                                                                                        | `vlanid: \|`<br />`{{ (fromConfigMap "site-config" "site1" "vlan") \| toInt }}`                                                              |
| `toBool`           | Returns the boolean value of the input string and ensures that the value is interpreted as a boolean in the YAML.                                                                                                   | `enabled: \|`<br />`{{ (fromConfigMap "site-config" "site1" "enabled") \| toBool }}`                                                         |
| `protect`          | Encrypts the input string. It is decrypted when the policy is evaluated. On the replicated policy in the managed cluster namespace, the resulting value resembles the following: `$ocm_encrypted:<encrypted-value>` | `enabled: \|`<br />`{{hub "(lookup "route.openshift.io/v1" "Route" "openshift-authentication" "oauth-openshift").spec.host \| protect hub}}` |
