After the cluster manager is installed on the hub cluster, you need to install the klusterlet agent on another cluster so that it can be registered and managed by the hub cluster.

## Prerequisite

Ensure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) and [kustomize](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/installation) are installed.

Ensure [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.

Ensure the open-cluster-management cluster manager is installed on the hub cluster. See [Install Cluster Manager](../install-cluster-manager) for more information.

Prepare another Kubernetes cluster to function as the managed cluster. For example, use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start) to create another cluster as below. To use kind, you will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started) installed and running.

```Shell
# kind delete cluster --name cluster1 # if the kind cluster is previously created and can be safely deleted
kind create cluster --name cluster1
kind get kubeconfig --name cluster1 --internal > ~/cluster1-kubeconfig
```

## Install from source

If you have not already done so, clone the `registration-operator`.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management/registration-operator
```

Ensure the `kubectl` context is set to point to the managed cluster:

```Shell
kubectl config use-context kind-cluster1
```

Deploy agent on a managed `kind` cluster.

```Shell
cd registration-operator
export KLUSTERLET_KIND_KUBECONFIG=~/cluster1-kubeconfig
export HUB_KIND_KUBECONFIG=</path/to/hub_kind_cluster/.kube/config> # export HUB_KIND_KUBECONFIG=~/hub-kubeconfig
make deploy-spoke-kind # make deploy-spoke-kind GO_REQUIRED_MIN_VERSION:= # if you see warnings regarding go version
```

## Install from OperatorHub
If you are using OpenShift or have `OLM` installed in your cluster, you are able to install the klusterlet with a released version from OperatorHub. Details can be found [here](https://operatorhub.io/operator/klusterlet).

## What is next

After a successful deployment, a `certificatesigningrequest` and a `managedcluster` will be created on the hub cluster.

```Shell
$ kubectl config use-context kind-hub
$ kubectl get csr
NAME                              AGE   REQUESTOR                       CONDITION
<managed cluster name>-<suffix>   41s   kubernetes-admin                Pending
csr-<suffix>                      76m   system:node:hub-control-plane   Approved,Issued
$ kubectl get managedcluster
NAME                    HUB ACCEPTED   MANAGED CLUSTER URLS   JOINED   AVAILABLE   AGE
<managed cluster name>  false          https://localhost                           57s
```

Next approve the certificate and set managecluster to be accepted by the hub with following commands:

```Shell
kubectl certificate approve {csr name}
kubectl patch managedcluster {managed cluster name} -p='{"spec":{"hubAcceptsClient":true}}' --type=merge
```

Run `kubectl get managedcluster` again on the hub cluster. You should be able to see that the managed cluster is registered now.

```Shell
NAME                     HUB ACCEPTED   MANAGED CLUSTER URLS   JOINED   AVAILABLE   AGE
<managed cluster name>   true           https://localhost      True     True        7m58s
```

After the managed cluster is registered, test that you can deploy a pod to the managed cluster from the hub cluster. Create a `manifest-work.yaml` as shown in this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: work.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManifestWork
metadata:
  name: mw-01
  namespace: <managed cluster name> # cluster1
spec:
  workload:
    manifests:
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: hello
        namespace: default
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: hello
          image: busybox
          command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello, Kubernetes!" && sleep 3600']
        restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the yaml file to the hub cluster.

```Shell
kubectl apply -f manifest-work.yaml
```

Verify that the `manifestwork` resource was applied to the hub.
```Shell
kubectl -n <managed cluster name> get manifestwork/mw-01 -o yaml # kubectl -n cluster1 get manifestwork/mw-01 -o yaml
```

Check on the managed cluster and see the _hello_ Pod has been deployed from the hub cluster.

```Shell
$ kubectl config use-context kind-cluster1
$ kubectl -n default get pod
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello   1/1     Running   0          108s
```
