title: What is Open Cluster Management?
---

Open Cluster Management provides end-to-end visibility and control to manage your Kubernetes environment. Take control of your application modernization program with management capabilities for cluster creation, application lifecycle, and provide security and compliance for all of them across data centers and hybrid cloud environments. Clusters and applications are all visible and managed from a single console with built-in security policies. Run your operations from a centralized Kubernetes environment, and manage any Kubernetes cluster in your fleet.

With the Open Cluster Management project, you can complete the following functionality tasks:

- Work across a range of environments, including multiple data centers, private clouds and public clouds that run Kubernetes clusters.
- Easily create Kubernetes clusters and offer cluster lifecycle management in a single console.
- Enforce policies at the target clusters using Kubernetes-supported custom resource definitions.
- Deploy and maintain day-two operations of business applications distributed across your cluster landscape.

## Mission Statement

We seek to add value to the community by a focused effort around many aspects of how users are deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters today. We seek to engage other parts of the community and both contribute to pre-existing efforts and invite contributors in those communities to cross-collaborate as part of this project.
